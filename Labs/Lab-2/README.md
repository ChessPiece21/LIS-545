# Lab 2: Introduction to Tabula
The application that we're exploring this week is a tool called [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) that allows us to extract tables (semi-structured data) from PDFs.

Tabula is a browser-based tool to extract tables embedded in PDFs, which is very useful for turning unstructured data into more structured documents. This is helpful for data curation work, since much of it requires managing, and working with, data tables, and this tool can make the tables found in many PDFs more accessible.

## Submission:
Please submit the extracted tables from Tabula as CSVs, with no cleaning or editing on your end.

## Tools:
- You can download Tabula here: https://tabula.technology/
- The following PDFs were used: 2016 King County Health Profile (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1613532/files/100291652/download), a [*PLoS One*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/) journal article (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1613532/files/100291661/download), and the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget from UW, which has LOTS of tables to play around with!
