# Lab 2: Introduction to Tabula
The application that we're exploring this week is a tool called [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) that allows us to extract tables (semi-structured data) from PDFs.


## Submission:
Please submit the extracted tables from Tabula as CSVs, with no cleaning or editing on your end.

## Tools:
- You can download Tabula here: https://tabula.technology/
- The following PDFs were used: 2016 King County Health Profile (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1613532/files/100291652/download), a ''PLoS One'' journal article (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1613532/files/100291661/download), and the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget from UW, which has LOTS of tables to play around with!
